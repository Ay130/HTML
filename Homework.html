<br>

        <main>
            <div class="small">Dear Eileen,</div>
<br>

    <div class="small">Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part <br> of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</div>
<br>
<b>Starting dates</b><br>
    <br><div class="small">We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you <br> could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</div>
<br>
<ul>
    <div class="small"><li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li></div>
    <div class="small"><li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li></div>
    <div class ="small"><li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li></div>
</ul>
<br>

    <div class="small">Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.
<br>
    <br> You can find more information about <a href="">important university dates</a> on our website.
</div>

<br>
<strong>Subjects of study</strong>
<br>
    <br><div class="small">At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall <br>somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just <br>the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued <br>by are as follows, in order of priority:
<br>
<ol>
    <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub> 14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li> 
    <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the <br> audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 103 increasing to 3 × 104.)</li>
    <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
</ol>
<br>
    So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the <br> research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.

    <strong>Exotic dance moves</strong>
<br>
    <br><div class="small">Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, <br> my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</div>
<br>
    <div class="small">Polynesian chicken dance</div>
    <div class="indent">A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around <br></div>
    <div class="indent">in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</div>
    <div class="small">Icelandic brownian shuffle</div>
        <div class="indent">Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which <br></div>
        <div class="indent">involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly <br></div>
        <div class="indent">tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance <br> </div>
        <div class="indent">inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</div>
    <div class="small">Arctic robot dance</div>
        <div class="indent">An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have <br></div>
        <div class="indent">discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants <br></div>
        <div class="indent">of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this <br></div>
        <div class="indent">because they were really cold.</div>
<br>
